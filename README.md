# OpenCVRoses
OpenCV art project

A few years ago, I did a project where I took a picture of a rose, and drew it in nine different ways. After taking a course on OpenCV, I decided
to try the same project with a techie twist!

The only libraries you will need are OpenCV, and numpy, which is used when you manipulate the color of the images. Both the original and new images
are stored in the "images" directory. Please see the requirments for version numbers. 

'Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Flowers are pretty,
And so are you!'
